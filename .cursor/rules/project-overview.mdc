# SentientEdge Codebase – Navigation Cheat-Sheet

## Front-end (Next.js 15 App Router)
• Source lives in the [app](mdc:app/) directory.  Each first-level folder is a route segment (e.g. [app/login](mdc:app/login/)).
• Global HTML shell & providers are composed in [app/layout.tsx](mdc:app/layout.tsx).
• Shared hooks go under [hooks](mdc:hooks/) – real-time logic is in [hooks/use-realtime.tsx](mdc:hooks/use-realtime.tsx) which consumes the ws helper in [lib/websocket.ts](mdc:lib/websocket.ts).

## Back-end (dev-only API + WS)
The lightweight Express server that the UI expects during local development is defined in [server.js](mdc:server.js).  It exposes:
```text
GET  /api/health     – simple health-check
WS   /ws             – JSON message bus used by use-realtime hook
```

## NPM Scripts
```text
npm run dev         – starts Next.js on :3000
npm run dev:backend – starts Express/WS on :3001
npm run dev:all     – runs both concurrently
```

## Styling & Tooling
Tailwind is configured in [tailwind.config.ts](mdc:tailwind.config.ts) and PostCSS in [postcss.config.mjs](mdc:postcss.config.mjs).
